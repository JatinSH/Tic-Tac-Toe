In the image 3, the inputs "Sherlock", "Irene" and "0" were added.
Further, "Irene" was given as the input in image 6.
Numbers (like 1,2,3 etc.) ranging from 1-9(both inclusive) were passed as the input.
The program automatically detects when a player wins, in this case Irene(Hooray!).
Any random key could be pressed to exit.
'Y' or 'y' could be pressed to restart the game from image 3.
